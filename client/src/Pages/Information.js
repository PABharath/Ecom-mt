the Goods or the manufacturing facility for the Goods, the lack of or inability to obtain raw materials,

Just like pure silk sarees, art silk sarees are airy, super light and really 
comfortable which makes them an ideal choice during the hot months of summer.

but will vary depending on the type of silk being imitated.

<p>
Cotton silk fabric is a blend of cotton and silk fibres, adding an extra layer 
of luster to a regular cotton saree. A lightweight silky and comfortable weave, 
cotton silk fabric has a soft hand-feel and a sturdy, silken drape.
